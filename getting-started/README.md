# Getting Started with CSAW High School Forensics

## Preparation
You must have the following as a bare minimum:

  * Notepad++, or another similar text editor (one more robust than Notepad)
    * Examples include ``vim``, ``emacs``, Atom, and Sublime Text
  * Hex Editor
    * I personally use [HxD] (https://mh-nexus.de/en/downloads.php?product=HxD)

  * ``nc host port``
